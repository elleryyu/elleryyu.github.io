I'm **Weifeng (Ellery) Yu**. I am a Research Assistant in the [NeuroBioInformatics Lab](https://neurobioinformatics.github.io/) at the **University of Virginia School of Data Science**, supervised by **Dr. Aiying Zhang**.

My research focuses on **computational neuroimaging** and **multimodal MRI analysis** to investigate large-scale brain organization in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions. I develop quantitative and computational methods to study brain connectivity, intrinsic neural dynamics, and complex biological signals. My goal is to derive interpretable, system-level insights from high-dimensional neuroimaging data to better understand brain function in health and disease.
